# SFB11 Similarity Scores

## Roadmap

-   fix similarity tables âœ…

-   sidebar collapse to start does not work, it covers the main UI section

-   get rid of plotly and figure out a better visualization...

    -   jitter with gghighlight so that you see the other people in that strategy, perhaps?

    -   facet-by-pca and do density charts with dots or lines or something?

-   incorporate the actual clusters somehow ?

-   incorporate ffsimulator results somehow ?
